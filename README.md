# Surfs Up
## Overview 
### The purpose of this analysis is to look at the temperatures for the months of June and December over a couple of years as a way to determine if a surf shop would be a savy investment. 
### Results
#### * When comparing the average temperatures in the month of June and December we see that the temperatures are fairly similar with December being slightly cooler. This is important because we are comparing temperatures from a summer month and a winter month and we can see very little deviation.

#### *Below we can see the descriptive statistics for June and December. The average temperature for June is almost 75 degrees and the average temperature for December is 71. We can see the means differentiate by only about 4 degrees. 
#### * When looking at the minimum temperatures for the month of June, it is 64 degrees. However, for the month of December it is a bit cooler at 56 degrees. The interquartile range for the month of June is 4 degrees and 5 degrees for the month of December. That means that on average, the temperatures do not vary too much during each month. The maximum temperature for June is 85 degrees and 83 degrees for December.

### Summary
#### * To take the analysis a step forward, I went ahead and included a filter to also filter by a specific year. Below are the statistics for the month of June for the year 2010 and 2017. The purpose for this was to see if there was any unusual weather during these two years. As we can see, both years show very similar weather to the averages for all years with 2017 being a little warmer.

#### * Similarly, I conducted the same analysis for December for two years, the years 2010 and 2016. When looking at the December temperatures for these particular years, the variation was not as evident. The mean temperature for December 2010 is less than one degree.
